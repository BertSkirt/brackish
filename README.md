# brackish

This site is my first full project in my quest to become a developer.

I set out to develop a more attractive webpage for Brackish Vodka.

I collected inspo from certain webpages recommended by Reddit users they deemed well done.

Currently working top down, starting with the nav bar. To include a responsive hamburger menu for mobile.

Next a scrollable main page that navigates their news, story, team and accomplishments.
